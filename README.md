    This is two player game where we will have boxes numbered from 1-5, for both players as shown below.

    Each player will generate a random number from 1-5 and it will be displayed for both players.

    As per the number generated, a human will be constructed (step-by-step starting from the head) in its respective row(as shown above).

    If the generated number gets repeated in the future turns for the same player the next part of the body will be added to the human of the respective box.

    The player constructing the full human in all the boxes wins.
